No phase may begin until the **explicit gate conditions** of the previous phase
are met.

---

## 🔓 Phase 1: OPEN — Theory & Community Scrutiny (CURRENT)

**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE  
**Visibility:** Public  
**Data Analysis:** ❌ Prohibited

### Objective

To harden the theoretical framework, expose assumptions, and invite
maximum community scrutiny **before any data analysis begins**.

This phase exists to eliminate hindsight bias and premature optimization.

### Deliverables

- `README.md` — Project scope and motivation  
- `FAQ_Hard_Questions.md` — Explicit confrontation of theoretical challenges  
- `Ethics_Statement.md` — Binding integrity and transparency commitments  
- `roadmap.md` — This document  
- (Optional) `Theory_Framework.md` — Mathematical sketches and physical intuition  

### Phase-1 Rules

- ❌ No observational data access
- ❌ No statistical testing
- ❌ No significance estimates
- ❌ No tuning of parameters
- ✔️ Conceptual discussion only

### Gate to Phase 2 (Closure Conditions)

Phase 1 is considered **closed** only when **all** of the following are satisfied:

1. All Phase-1 documents are stable in the `main` branch  
2. Core theoretical parameters are **frozen** (e.g., no further modification of
   proposed scaling relations or observables)  
3. A minimum **4-week public scrutiny window** has elapsed  
4. No unresolved, project-halting logical flaws have been identified  

Once Phase 1 is closed:
- No new observables may be introduced
- No theoretical tuning is permitted to improve future results

## 🔒 Phase 2: PRIVATE — Blinded Analysis & Testing

**Status:** 🔒 FUTURE  
**Visibility:** Private repository  
**Data Analysis:** ✔️ Allowed (under strict controls)

### Objective

To perform a **neutral, blinded, and fully documented test** of MOSGM predictions
against observational data, free from public pressure or result-driven coding.

### Core Rules

- All work is conducted in a **private repository**
- Analysis proceeds under **pre-specified assumptions**
- No public release of intermediate results
- No retroactive parameter adjustment
- No introduction of new observables after Phase-1 closure

### Mandatory Components

1. **Data Ingestion & Pipeline Freeze**
   - Input datasets defined
   - Processing pipeline fixed before evaluation

2. **Decision Logging**
   - Every analytical choice recorded in `Decision_Log.md`
   - Includes:
     - rejected approaches
     - failed attempts
     - rationale for each decision

3. **Sensitivity & Robustness Testing**
   - Sensitivity Matrix construction
   - Dependence on assumptions explicitly mapped

4. **Null-Hypothesis & Bias Tests**
   - Control samples
   - Randomized or scrambled tests
   - Explicit systematics checks

### Deliverables (Private, Pre-Unblinding)

- Complete analysis codebase
- Fully populated `Decision_Log.md`
- Results of all null and bias tests
- Internal summary of **procedure only** (not conclusions)

### Gate to Phase 3

Phase 2 is complete only when:

- The analysis pipeline is frozen
- All planned null tests are executed
- The Decision Log provides a complete audit trail
- No unresolved methodological issues remain

---

## 🌍 Phase 3: PUBLIC — Disclosure & Peer Review

**Status:** 🔓 FUTURE  
**Visibility:** Public  
**Trigger:** Automatic upon Phase-2 completion

### Objective

To publicly disclose results **regardless of outcome**, with full transparency
and reproducibility.

### Disclosure Commitments

- Phase-2 private repository becomes public
- All analysis scripts and logs released
- Full reporting of:
  - positive results
  - negative results
  - null findings
- No selective reporting

### Outputs

1. Public analysis repository (code + logs)
2. Preprint manuscript (e.g., arXiv)
3. Journal submission for peer review
4. Update to the main MOSGM repository summarizing outcomes

### Final Integrity Commitment

Phase 3 **will proceed regardless of whether MOSGM is supported, weakened,
or falsified**.

Null or negative outcomes are considered valid and valuable scientific results.

---

## 🚦 Strategic Commitments

- **Pre-Registration:** Parameters frozen in Phase 1 cannot be altered in Phase 2  
- **No Goalpost Shifting:** No new observables after Phase-1 closure  
- **Negative Result Integrity:** Failure modes will be reported explicitly  
- **Auditability:** Independent researchers must be able to reproduce every step  

> Methodology is evaluated independently of conclusions.

---

## 📌 Closing Statement

This roadmap is intentionally restrictive.

Its purpose is not to maximize the chance of success, but to maximize
the credibility of whatever result emerges.

By committing to this structure, the MOSGM project prioritizes
**process over promise** and **integrity over outcome**.
