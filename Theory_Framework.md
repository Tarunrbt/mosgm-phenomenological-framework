# MOSGM Project — Theory Framework
## Mathematical Sketches & Physical Intuition

**Status:** Phase-1 (Open Theory Phase)  
**Scope:** Conceptual / Phenomenological  
**Data Use:** None  
**Claims:** None (No empirical validation attempted here)

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document outlines the **theoretical framework, physical intuition, and mathematical sketches**
underlying the Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model (MOSGM).

MOSGM is presented strictly as a **phenomenological ansatz**, not as a complete or fundamental theory
of gravity. The purpose of this document is to:

- Make all theoretical assumptions explicit  
- Define the physical mechanism being proposed  
- Fix the mathematical structure *prior to any data analysis*  
- Identify known theoretical limitations and open problems  

This document contains **no observational data, no statistical testing, and no fitted parameters**.

---

## 2. Core Phenomenological Postulate

MOSGM is based on the following postulate:

> **Spacetime responds to baryonic matter not only through curvature,
> but also through a scale-dependent gradient response that becomes dynamically relevant
> when the local gravitational acceleration approaches a characteristic scale \( a_0 \).**

This response is interpreted as a **medium-like behavior of spacetime gradients**, not as
a modification of force laws or inertia.

## 3. Gradient-Based Picture of Gravity

### 3.1 From Force Laws to Gradient Response

In standard Newtonian and relativistic gravity, dynamics are determined by:

\[
\mathbf{g} = -\nabla \Phi
\]

MOSGM does **not** propose altering this relation directly.

Instead, it hypothesizes that:

- The **structure** of \( \nabla \Phi \) itself changes when the magnitude of the gradient
  crosses a characteristic threshold.
- This change manifests as a localized transition in dynamical observables
  sensitive to second-order structure in the potential.

Thus, MOSGM shifts focus from:
> *“What is the force?”*  
to:
> *“How does the spacetime gradient field respond to matter?”*

## 4. Emergence of the Characteristic Radius \( r_t \)

### 4.1 Dimensional and Physical Motivation

Assume:
- Baryonic mass \( M_b \)
- A universal acceleration scale \( a_0 \)

The only radius that can be constructed dimensionally is:

\[
r_t \sim \sqrt{\frac{G M_b}{a_0}}
\]

This scale corresponds to the radius at which the **Newtonian gravitational acceleration**
due to baryons satisfies:

\[
|\nabla \Phi| \sim a_0
\]

MOSGM interprets this radius as a **transition zone** where the spacetime gradient response
changes character.

### 4.2 Interpretation

- \( r_t \) is **not** a boundary of mass distribution
- \( r_t \) is **not** a fitted scale
- \( r_t \) emerges from the interaction between baryonic sourcing and gradient response

This radius is therefore predicted *a priori* once \( M_b \) and \( a_0 \) are specified.

---

## 5. Why the Observable \( d\sigma^2 / dr \)?

### 5.1 Physical Rationale

Velocity dispersion \( \sigma^2(r) \) encodes the **integrated gravitational potential**.

Taking a radial derivative,

\[
\frac{d\sigma^2}{dr}
\]

enhances sensitivity to **localized changes in the gradient structure** of the potential.

If spacetime exhibits a transition in gradient response near \( r_t \), then:

- The effect may be subtle in \( \sigma^2(r) \)
- But becomes more pronounced in its derivative

MOSGM therefore predicts a **localized structure** (enhancement or suppression)
in \( d\sigma^2/dr \) near \( r_t \).

### 5.2 Why a “Spike-like” Feature?

A medium-response transition generically produces:
- Non-monotonic behavior
- Local extrema
- Rapid but continuous changes

MOSGM does **not** assume a sharp discontinuity.
Any observed “spike” would represent a **smooth but localized response**, not a singularity.

---

## 6. Relation to MOND

MOSGM shares **phenomenological overlap** with MOND but differs structurally.

### Key distinctions:

| MOND | MOSGM |
|----|----|
| Modifies force law or inertia | Modifies spacetime gradient response |
| Acceleration-based interpolation | Gradient-structure transition |
| Typically isotropic | Potentially sensitive to geometric environment |

MOSGM makes **no claim** to replace MOND.
Identifying **falsifiable differences** between the two frameworks is a stated goal
of later phases.

## 7. Known Theoretical Limitations (“Theoretical Debt”)

MOSGM explicitly acknowledges unresolved issues:

1. **Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP)**  
   A consistent UV completion must explain how baryon-selective sourcing
   avoids violating precision WEP tests.

2. **Baryon Selectivity**  
   No first-principles justification is currently provided.
   This is treated as an empirical question, not a theoretical assumption.

3. **Cosmology and Structure Formation**  
   MOSGM is not presently a cosmological model.
   Compatibility with CMB/LSS is deferred to future work.

These limitations are **not hidden** and are not claimed solved.

---

## 8. Falsifiability Commitment

MOSGM is explicitly falsifiable.

Failure modes include:
- Breakdown of the \( r_t \propto \sqrt{M_b/a_0} \) scaling
- Absence of any localized structure near \( r_t \)
- Requirement of inconsistent \( a_0 \) values across systems

The analysis pipeline in Phase-2 is designed to **detect these failures**, not obscure them.

---

## 9. Phase-1 Closure Statement

This document completes the **theoretical specification** of MOSGM.

No further modifications to:
- The postulate
- The scaling relations
- The chosen observable

will be made once Phase-1 is formally closed.

Any future changes must be clearly labeled as **new theoretical versions**, not revisions.

---

## Final Note

This framework is intentionally conservative.

MOSGM does not seek acceptance through bold claims,
but through **process integrity, transparency, and falsifiability**.

Whether the model succeeds or fails empirically,
the methodology itself is designed to produce scientifically useful outcomes.
