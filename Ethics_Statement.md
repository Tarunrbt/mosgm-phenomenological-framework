# MOSGM Project — Research Ethics & Transparency Statement

## 📜 Purpose of This Document

This document formally records the ethical principles, transparency commitments, and scientific integrity standards governing the MOSGM (Matter-Originated Spacetime Gradient Model) project.

Its purpose is to ensure that:
- Methodology remains independent of outcomes
- No data-driven tuning or post-hoc justification occurs
- The project is evaluated on **process integrity**, not results alone

This statement functions as a binding methodological contract for all project phases.

## 1. Declaration of Pre-Specification (Blinding Principle)

All core theoretical elements intended for empirical testing were **locked prior to any formal data analysis**.

These include, but are not limited to:

- The scaling relation  
  **rₜ ∝ √(M_b / a₀)**
- The primary observable  
  **localized structure in dσ²/dr**
- The characteristic acceleration scale  
  **a₀ ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ m s⁻²** (fixed, not fitted)

These parameters were not optimized, tuned, or adjusted based on any dataset.

This approach follows the spirit of **pre-registration**, even where no formal registry is used.

---

## 2. Rationale for Strict Stage Separation

The MOSGM project is intentionally divided into three isolated phases:

### Phase 1 — Open (Public)
- Conceptual framework
- Mathematical sketches
- Pre-specified predictions
- Anticipated theoretical challenges
- Public documentation only

**No data, statistics, or empirical claims are allowed in this phase.**

### Phase 2 — Private (Blinded Analysis)
- Data ingestion and pipeline development
- Sensitivity analysis and error estimation
- Null-hypothesis testing
- Systematics and bias audits

All analysis is conducted in a **private repository** to prevent:
- Premature result exposure
- Outcome-driven decision pressure
- Public misinterpretation of intermediate states

### Phase 3 — Public Disclosure
- Release of analysis code
- Publication of results (positive, null, or negative)
- Full reproducibility and auditability

Stage separation is enforced to protect the science **from confirmation bias — including the authors’ own**.

## 3. Safeguards Against p-Hacking and Post-Hoc Tuning

The project commits to the following safeguards:

- **Decision Logging:**  
  Every significant analytical choice during Phase 2 will be recorded in a Decision Log, including:
  - Options considered
  - Rationale for selection
  - Rejected alternatives

- **Null Tests:**  
  Control tests and falsification checks will be performed and reported.

- **No Selective Reporting:**  
  Results will be reported based on predefined criteria, regardless of statistical significance or narrative appeal.

- **Look-Elsewhere Awareness:**  
  Any exploratory scans or secondary correlations will be explicitly labeled and conservatively corrected where applicable.

---

## 4. Commitment to Negative and Null Results

The MOSGM project explicitly recognizes **negative or null results as scientifically valuable outcomes**.

Accordingly, we commit to:

- Publishing results even if they:
  - Show no statistically significant signal
  - Contradict the MOSGM hypothesis
  - Require abandonment or revision of core assumptions

- Releasing:
  - Analysis scripts
  - Null-test outputs
  - Error estimates and covariance structures

A lack of confirmation is treated as information — not failure.

---

## 5. Non-Commercial and Peer-Driven Nature

This project is:

- Non-commercial
- Self-directed
- Free of financial, patent, or proprietary incentives

Its purpose is to engage the scientific community in transparent, critical evaluation of a proposed phenomenological framework.

No outcomes are pre-judged or desired beyond methodological clarity.

---

## 6. Scope and Acknowledged Limitations

MOSGM is presented **strictly as a phenomenological framework**, not as a complete or UV-complete theory of gravity.

Open theoretical challenges include:
- Equivalence principle consistency
- Baryon-selective coupling mechanisms
- Compatibility with relativistic and cosmological frameworks

These are explicitly acknowledged as **future theoretical obligations**, not resolved claims.

---

## Summary

- No empirical claims are made in the Open Phase
- Theory and data analysis are rigorously separated
- Transparency and reproducibility are prioritized over outcomes
- Community scrutiny is invited, not avoided

This Ethics Statement is an integral and non-negotiable component of the MOSGM project.
