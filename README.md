## 🔒 Phase-1 Closure (Theory Freeze Declaration)

**Status:** Phase-1 (Open / Conceptual Phase) — **CLOSED**

All theoretical development for the MOSGM project has now been **publicly frozen**.

### What is frozen
- Core phenomenological postulates
- Scaling relations (e.g. \( r_t \propto \sqrt{M_b / a_0} \))
- Defined observables (e.g. structural features in \( d\sigma^2/dr \))
- Conceptual assumptions documented in:
  - `Theory_Framework.md`
  - `FAQ_Hard_Questions.md`
  - `Ethics_Statement.md`
  - `roadmap.md`

### What this guarantees
- No hindsight bias
- No post-hoc tuning
- No theory modification after data exposure

### What is explicitly prohibited
- No observational data access
- No statistical testing
- No parameter tuning
- No significance estimation

Phase-1 is closed for a **minimum freeze period of four (4) weeks**, as defined in `roadmap.md`.

All empirical testing will occur **only in Phase-2 (Private Analysis Phase)**, followed by full public disclosure regardless of outcome.

> *This freeze ensures that MOSGM is evaluated on process integrity, not outcome desirability.*
