# MOSGM — FAQ: Hard Questions (The Gauntlet)

This document anticipates and openly addresses the most difficult and legitimate criticisms that the MOSGM framework is expected to face.  
Its purpose is not defense by rhetoric, but defense by transparency.

Avoiding these questions would undermine the scientific integrity of the project.

---

## 1. Is MOSGM a complete theory of gravity?

**Short answer:** No.

MOSGM is explicitly presented as a **phenomenological framework**, not a complete relativistic theory.  
Its role is to identify and test empirical regularities in low-acceleration regimes that may point toward deeper physics.

Any consistent UV-complete theory (if one exists) is future work.

---

## 2. Does MOSGM violate the Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP)?

This is a **known and acknowledged theoretical challenge**.

If spacetime dynamics respond preferentially to baryonic matter, then a consistent completion must explain:
- Why standard WEP tests are preserved in high-precision regimes
- How screening or effective coupling mechanisms operate

At the current stage, MOSGM treats this as **theoretical debt**, not a resolved issue.

---

## 3. Why should spacetime respond to baryonic matter specifically?

This is the **core phenomenological assumption** of MOSGM.

At present:
- No first-principles justification is claimed
- The motivation is empirical, not aesthetic

If future observations robustly prefer baryonic scaling relations, the burden shifts to theory to explain the coupling — not the other way around.

Historical precedent exists for charge-selective interactions in physics.

---

## 4. Is MOSGM just MOND under a different name?

No, but the overlap is acknowledged.

Key distinctions:
- MOND modifies force laws or inertia
- MOSGM explores **spacetime gradient response** as a medium-like effect

The two frameworks may coincide in certain limits while diverging in others.  
Identifying **falsifiable differences** is an explicit goal of future phases.

---

## 5. How does MOSGM handle galaxy clusters?

Clusters are a **critical stress test**.

MOSGM makes no claim of guaranteed success at cluster scales.  
If predictions calibrated at galactic scales fail in clusters, this will be treated as a **negative result and reported openly**.

No cluster-specific tuning will be introduced.

---

## 6. What about cosmology (CMB, LSS)?

MOSGM is **not currently a cosmological model**.

Possible interpretations (speculative, not claimed):
- Late-time, scale-dependent modification
- Effective medium response below ~1 Mpc scales

Compatibility with cosmology is future work and not assumed.

---

## 7. Is MOSGM falsifiable?

Yes — explicitly.

Examples of failure modes:
1. Breakdown of the proposed baryonic scaling relation
2. Requirement of inconsistent acceleration scales across systems
3. Persistent disagreement with clean, high-quality datasets

The analysis pipeline is designed to detect these failures, not hide them.

---

## 8. Why should the community take this seriously?

Because of **process, not promises**.

Key commitments:
- Pre-specified predictions
- Strict separation of theory and data analysis
- Full disclosure of negative or null results
- Public documentation of assumptions and limitations

The credibility of MOSGM rests on methodology, not outcomes.

## Closing Note

This document is intentionally uncomfortable.

By confronting weaknesses early and publicly, the project aims to protect the science from confirmation bias — including from its own authors.

This file remains editable **only during the Open Phase**.
